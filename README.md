Description:
The New Jersey Point-In Time (PIT) Count is an annual state-wide survey of individuals and families that are experiencing homelessness 
on a given night in January. This data helps better understand the issues facing some of New Jersey's most vulnerable residents as well 
as how best to allocate community resources and services to meet their needs. 

This site provides a 3-year summary of PIT results viewed at both state-wide and county levels. Data focuses on Total Homelessness as 
well as subpopulations Chronic Homelessness and Unsheltered Homelessness. This data is presented in an interactive map, graph, chart 
as well as in table form. Users can select each option in the left navigation bar. A drop-down menu within the navigation bar allows 
the user to select the data to be visualized.
